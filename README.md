## How to create your own copy of this app?
### Prerequisites
To create your own copy of this application, here are the prerequisites:

 - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system or simply use npm if you prefer.
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) installed on your system.
 - Have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and paths set properly.
 - An android emulator or real device to run the app.
 - A google account for having [Firebase Web](https://firebase.google.com) configuration.
 - Xcode installed to test the app on an iOS devices or simulator.

### Build your own copy
First clone the repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/jsappme/react-native-firebase-starter.git
    cd react-native-firebase-starter

Then install the dependencies using:

    yarn

To link the react-native-vector-icons package to react native:

    react-native link

Perform the **Firebase Setup** below

Then run the following command to run the app on the emulator.

    react-native run-android

or if you have Xcode installed:

    react-native run-ios

To see the logs:

    react-native log-android

or

    react-native log-ios

##Firebase Setup

Create a new app at:
https://console.firebase.google.com/

Enable the Email/Password provider for your sign-in method at:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOURPROJECT/authentication/providers

Copy the `src/firebase-example.js` to `src/firebase.js`

**Note:** the `.gitignore` includes `src/firebase.js` so it won't accidentally get checked in

Copy your Firebase variables to the `src/firebase.js` by clicking on **Add Firebase to your web app** icon at:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOURPROJECT/settings/general/

Edit and publish your rules and indexOn at:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOURPROJECT/database/rules

with:

    {
      "rules": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null",
      "posts": {".indexOn": "timestamp"}
      }
    }

and edit the firebase configuration file with your own settings:

    atom src/firebase.js

Now, you have your own copy of this application!
